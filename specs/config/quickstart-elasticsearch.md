### Configuration: `quickstart-elasticsearch.properties`

#### File Summary
This file configures a Kafka Connect Elasticsearch Sink Connector for quick-start demonstration purposes. It defines the connector's name, class, target topic, Elasticsearch connection details, and basic indexing behavior.

#### Configuration Details
- **`name`**: `elasticsearch-sink`
  - The logical name for this connector instance.
- **`connector.class`**: `io.confluent.connect.elasticsearch.ElasticsearchSinkConnector`
  - Specifies the fully qualified class name of the Kafka Connect Elasticsearch Sink Connector.
- **`tasks.max`**: `1`
  - The maximum number of tasks that can be created for this connector.
- **`topics`**: `test-elasticsearch-sink`
  - The Kafka topic from which the connector will consume messages.
- **`key.ignore`**: `true`
  - Indicates that the Kafka message key should be ignored when indexing into Elasticsearch.
- **`connection.url`**: `http://localhost:9200`
  - The URL for connecting to the Elasticsearch cluster.
- **`type.name`**: `kafka-connect`
  - The Elasticsearch document type name to be used for indexed documents.

#### Environment & Secrets
- **Elasticsearch Host**: `localhost:9200` (hardcoded)
  - The target Elasticsearch instance.

#### Notes
- This configuration is intended for a quick-start setup and uses hardcoded Elasticsearch connection details. In a production environment, these should be externalized.
- The connector is configured to ignore Kafka message keys, meaning Elasticsearch document IDs will be generated by Elasticsearch or derived from the message value.
