# Validation Report

## Unmapped/Missing Files
All relevant project files have been processed into Markdown specifications, summarized in `Project.md`, or explicitly listed as skipped. There are no unmapped or missing files that should have generated a dedicated specification.

## Redactions
The following sensitive values were identified and redacted in the generated specifications:
-   **PostgreSQL Database Password**: The password `postgres` was found hardcoded in `src/main/java/nb/edu/kafkaes/util/DemoDataSource.java` and `connect/source-rdbms/connect.properties`. It has been redacted to `<REDACTED: postgres>` in the generated documentation.

## Notes
-   The project is Gradle-based, and the specification generation adapted to this structure, noting that Maven-specific elements like `pom.xml` parsing were not applicable.
-   No REST controllers were detected in the Java source code, so no OpenAPI specification was generated.
